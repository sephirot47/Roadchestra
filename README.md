# Roadchestra

Roadchestra is an application made for SEAT Hackathon 2016, that lets you make an song queue in your car, into which every car passenger can send their own music. The server has an OBEX Bluetooth server that receives the files, and the client are the Android mobile phones, which can send its music via Bluetooth Sharing.

Made with JFons and AinaSG.
